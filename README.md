This Git repository contains supporting files for my "Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)" video course. See https://sandervanvugt.com for more details. It is also used in the "CKA Crash Course" that I'm teaching at https://learning.oreilly.com. 

In this course you need to have your own lab environment. This lab environment should consist of 3 virtual machines, using Ubuntu LTS server 20.4 or later (22.4 is recommended)
Make sure the virtual machines meet the following requirements
*	2GB RAM
*	2 vCPUs
*	20 GB disk space
*	No swap
For instructions on how to set up Ubuntu Server 22.04, see the document "Installing Ubuntu 22-04" in this Git repository.
For information on getting started with VirtualBox, see this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qwUHSaIJdY

MAY 2023 NOTE: The Calico network plugin has been changing a lot lately. I recommend following the instructions at https://docs.tigera.io/calico/latest/getting-started/kubernetes/quickstart to install the Calico network plugin.
